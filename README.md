# Cli-RPN-Calculator
Command Line Utility for Reverse Polish Notation Calculator


1) A high-level description of your solution

2) Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural
    - Nodejs
        - simple to scale with web socket, files, etc
        - Readline over zx terminal: 
    - Jest: for simplicity and ease of starting testing. Easier for others without testing knowledge to be integrated and contribute 


3) Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project
    - Would implement mocha for testing as it stays lightweight from custom configuration as opposed to Jest coming with a full suite of tools that might not necessarily be needed

4) How to run your code, if applicable
    currently - node index.js
    later - script "start calculator" (have not been written)

5) Link to the hosted application, if applicable
